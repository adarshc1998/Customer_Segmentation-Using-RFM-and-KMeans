# Identifying-target-customer-segments-using-a-two-stage-RFM-and-KMeans

The company's primary focus is not on how to get new potential customers but how to sell 
more products to the existing customers because the cost that companies must incur to acquire 
new customers is much more expensive than to retain existing customers. Therefore, this repository is all about
obtaining homogeneous groups and identifying the star customers. 

The model used in this repository is RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) 
commonly used to perform the last visit time grouping, visit frequency, and revenue obtained by the company
The reason why continuing to use the RFM model is that it is easy to use and quickly implemented in companies, 
and in addition RFM is easily understood by managers and marketing decision makers
